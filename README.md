TalkingData Mobile User Demographics Kaggle competition code and data repository.  Christopher (me), Joe, and Paul, are co-workers that decided to try their hands at this Kaggle competition! 

Kaggle has a way to assign competition medals that get featured on your Kaggle profile.  For the competition that we're working on, there are currently about 900 teams, which means that to get a Bronze Medal we need to finish in the Top 100, to get a Silver Medal we need to finish in the Top 50, to get a Gold Medal we need to get into the Top 10 + 0.2% of teams.  Our goal first and formost for this project is to learn; learn to become better modellers, data scientists, and team members. Our secondary goal is to get a Bronze Medal!  We'd all be very proud to achieve that secondary goal.
